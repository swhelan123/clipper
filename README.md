# Clipper 📋🤖

A macOS clipboard watcher that automatically queries Google's Gemini AI with whatever you copy, replacing your clipboard with the AI's response.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is designed for learning and productivity. **I am not responsible if this tool is used to cheat in exams or violate academic integrity policies.** Use it ethically and in accordance with your institution's policies.

## What It Does

Clipper runs in the background and monitors your macOS clipboard. When it detects new text:

1. **Sends it to Gemini AI** along with recent conversation history for context
2. **Gets an intelligent response** tailored for programmers and students
3. **Replaces your clipboard** with the AI's answer
4. **Maintains context** across multiple clipboard operations

Perfect for quick code fixes, concept explanations, or formatting snippets without leaving your workflow.

## Features

- 🔄 **Automatic clipboard monitoring** - polls every second
- 💬 **Conversational context** - remembers recent exchanges (up to 5 Q&A pairs)
- 🎯 **Smart response formatting**:
  - Code queries → clean code blocks only
  - Questions → concise 3-sentence explanations
- 🚫 **Loop prevention** - won't process its own responses
- 🧠 **Optimized for CS/Math students** - understands technical queries

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** (uses `pbpaste` and `pbcopy`)
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Google Gemini API key**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clipper.git
   cd clipper
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install google-genai
   ```

3. **Set up your API key:**

   Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), then set it as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   Or add it to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` to persist across sessions:

   ```bash
   echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the watcher:**
   ```bash
   python3 clipper.py
   ```

2. **Copy something** (⌘C) - any text, code snippet, or question

3. **Paste** (⌘V) - you'll get the AI's response instead!

**Example workflow:**
- Copy: `fix this python loop` followed by buggy code
- Paste: Get corrected code ready to use
- Copy: `what is a linked list`
- Paste: Get a concise explanation

## Configuration

You can adjust these constants in `clipper.py`:

- `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: How often to check clipboard (default: 1.0)
- `CONTEXT_CHAR_LIMIT`: Max characters of history to maintain (default: 4000)
- `HISTORY_MAX_EXCHANGES`: Max Q&A pairs to remember (default: 5)

## System Prompt

Clipper uses a specialized system prompt that:
- Provides code-only responses when you need code
- Gives brief explanations for conceptual questions
- Responds in the same language as your query
- Skips pleasantries and gets straight to the answer

## Stopping the Watcher

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Clipper is running.

## Tips

- **Code fixes**: Copy broken code with a brief description at the top
- **Quick lookups**: Copy technical terms or function names
- **Format conversion**: Copy data and specify the desired format
- **Context matters**: Recent clipboard operations inform current responses

## Limitations

- macOS only (Linux/Windows would need different clipboard commands)
- Requires active internet connection
- API rate limits apply (Gemini free tier is generous)
- Not suitable for very large code files (stays under context limits)

## Privacy Note

Your clipboard contents are sent to Google's Gemini API. Don't copy sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal data) while Clipper is running.
